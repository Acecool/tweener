#summary Stuff that needs to be done. Pretty chaotic.

This list things that need to be done on Tweener.

Most stuff like bugs and decisions should be listed on the "issues" tab instead of here. This is just a basic list before it gets moved to a more serious issue. Some of this stuff has even been done already.

==Bugs==


===Other small random bugs===
 * skipUpdates with no property being tweened causes it to never run onUpdate.. must update the count of updates skipped even when not updating anything!
 * tScope disappearing after an onComplete.apply?
 * sometimes onComplete gets called twice???! attempts to delete it cause strange behavior. --> apparently the duplication happens when there are several tweenings on the same object
 * looks like skipUpdates isn't working very well when using special properties - for example, blurX/blurY updater for Miller MGD. Gotta test.
 * calling a Tweener.addTween on a function that's called by a Tweener.addTween onComplete parameter is not working - for example, Miller MGD's showMaoR
 * fix/check onOverwrite... it indeed should have the property name as a parameter?
 * apparently .removeTweens() executed on a movieclip immediately before one .addTween is done on a child of the movieclip causes the first .addTween to fail. example: absolut ruby red, drink curtain animation.


==Features===

===Debug level===

Add a debugLevel/setDebugLevel/etc for debugging purposes... As in
 # LOG ERRORS: trace try..catch data2
 # LOG WARNINGS: trace non-fatal warnings, such as the transition time normalization
 # LOG INFORMATION: trace stuff like all updates/adds/completion


===Other small random features===

 * allow arrays as the transition parameter so it can use multi-equation transitions
 * onUpdate must be fired even if there's no property being tweened?
 * registerSpecialProperty should allow special additional parameters? to avoid the problem of repeated functions like `_`color`_*` on SpecialPropertiesDefault (so just a generic function could handle it all)
 * make removeTweens/resumeTweens/pauseTweens accept property names
 * setDebugModifierKey() so timeScale can easily be changed when debugging (ie, SHIFT activates fast-forward)
 * properly support .useFrames!
 * when restaring the movie twice in a roll with ctrl+enter from the flash IDE, problems arise because flash doesn't reset class variables. existing tweenings carry? check a better way of using `_`engineExists...
 * make a proper addCaller (fix the existing one) - suggested by Paulo Afonso
 * addCaller doesn't work with several movieclips. calledTimes should be independent from scope... or call them all at the same time?
 * add endTween, skipTween (scrub?).. as suggested by Ephraim Tabackman
 * add onPauseTween()
 * add onResumeTween()
 * add onRemove()
 * add MultiSpecialPropertyModifier or something to that effect - for `_`color`_`transform, `_`color, `_`filter`_`blur, etc (to avoid the current internal hack)


===Decisions, decisions===

 * add something like .autoInvisible/.autoVisible so `_`alpha updates can automatically hide or show a given object -- maybe an `_`autoAlpha property?
 * immediately update after executing .addTween? or wait until the next enterFrame?
 * add properties such as .t (time) / .d (delay) / .e (equation?) on addTween().. probably impossible because they start with the same letters
 * add 'isSpecial' for special properties on the list ... to make it faster?
 * CORRECT movieclip color tint with ColorTransform on AS2?
 * add .scopes back, but making it some kind of special multi-tween in which variables are tied together?
 * TODO: make on`*`() events also respond to instances... use addListener?


==Documentation==

 * Properly mention in custom functions: http://timotheegroleau.com/Flash/experiments/easing_function_generator.htm


==Special properties==

===Done===

 * `_`color: integer tint, turns into `_`color`_*` (!!!should be a proper parameter, not hardcoded as of now!!!)
 * `_`colorTransform: colortransform object, uses the `_`color`_*` equivalent (!!!should be a proper parameter, not hardcoded as of now!!!)
 * `_`color`_`ra ...rb ...ga ...gb ...ba ...bb ...aa ...ab
 * `_`frame
 * `_`sound`_`pan
 * `_`sound`_`volume

===To do===

 * textfield
   * color
   * scroll
   * leading
   * letterspacing
   * fontsize

 * filters...

 * other 'special' properties that need 'touch' like scrollrect, colortransform, etc
 * something for a bezier slide - normal _x and _y tween, plus control points?
 * add a new "special properties" class for color transformation properties - ie, `_`brightness, `_`hue, stuff like that


==A lot of random stuff with no proper wiki format==

As suggested by Nate Chatellier:

 * undefined|null: @see http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flex/2/langref/migration.html#undefined, should check to see if it can be unified for AS2/AS3
 * the easing functions, undefined checks should be verified -> "In the EasingFunctions class, I replaced all references of if (s == undefined) to if (!s) (due to the Number.NaN initialization)"

Also suggested by Nate, for AS3 only:
 * equations (and others?) should have default values for optional parameters
 * glued movieclip creation.... check `_`root references
