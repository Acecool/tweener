= Tweening Parameters =

When creating new tweenings via [addTween], all properties inside the last parameter object are assumed to be properties from the object that need to be tweened. However, there are a number of built-in parameters that override this behavior, and are instead used to define the functionality of the tweening itself.

== Transition parameters ==

Parameters that declare how the transition should behave.

=== time ===

Number; used to control how long this transition will take. It's expressed in seconds. If a value of 0 is used, or if this property is omitted, the tween is created, executed with its final value, and deleted immediately.

==== Examples ====

{{{
// Makes a MovieClip move to _x = 100 in 2 seconds
Tweener.addTween(<movieclip> {_x:100, time:2});

// Immediately moves a MovieClip to _x = 100
Tweener.addTween(<movieclip> {_x:100});
}}}
