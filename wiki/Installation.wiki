#summary How to install Tweener

= Installation =

Differently from "extensions", you don't have to actually install anything with classes. You just download them and place them somewhere where you can use them.

Here are some easy steps:

 # Download Tweener, either from the [http://code.google.com/p/tweener/downloads/list stable downloads list], or from [http://code.google.com/p/tweener/source Subversion];
 # Extract the files (if you downloaded a ZIP archive) somewhere;
 # Move all files, including their folder structure, to your project source directory;
 # Use them on your project by importing the class and calling its methods. Make sure you have the class location included on your _classpath_ list.

If you're new to classes, see the [HowToUseAClass how to use a class] page. If you're used to MC Tween, also see [DifferencesBetweenMCTweenAndTweener Differences between MC Tween and Tweener].

While Tweener doesn't offer any kind of syntax highlighting, code hinting or auto completion yet, good Actionscript editors such as [http://www.flashdevelop.org FlashDevelop] will automatically provide these features by analyzing the source files themselves.
